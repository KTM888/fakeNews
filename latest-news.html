        </header><br>

        <br>Detection of fake news online is important in today's society as fresh news content is rapidly being produced as a result of the abundance of technology that is present. In the world of false news, there are seven main categories and within each category, the piece of fake news content can be visual- and/or linguistic-based. In order to detect fake news, both linguistic and non-linguistic cues can be analyzed using several methods. While many of these methods of detecting fake news are generally successful, they do have some limitations. Varied linguistics cues implies that a new cue set must be designed for a prospective situation which makes it difficult to generalize cue and feature engineering methods across different topics and domains. Such approaches therefore would require more human involvement in the design process, evaluation and utilization of these cues for detection.<br>

        <br>Fake News is not something that is new however, as technology evolves and advances over time, the detection of Fake News also becomes more challenging as social media continues to dominate our everyday lives and hence accelerating the speed of which Fake News travel at. Fake news detection is still a challenge even to deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent neural network (RNN), etc., because the content of fake news is planned in a way it resembles the truth so as to deceive readers; and without cross referencing and fact checking, it is often difficult to determine veracity by text analysis alone.<br>
