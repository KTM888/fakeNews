            Google wants to combat the infodemic that has been experienced during the pandemic and this Tuesday
            the Google News Initiative launched a global open fund of up to 3 million dollars to repel fake news
            about COVID-19 vaccines.

            As Alphabet said in a blog post , this fund aims to combat inoculation misinformation by supporting
            journalistic efforts to effectively verify misinformation about immunization campaigns.

            "While the COVID-19 infodemic has been global in nature, misinformation has also been used to
            target
            specific populations."
        </p>
        <h3>How will the fund work?</h3>
        <p>
            Google News Initiative will accept projects that want to expand their audiences by verifying facts related
            to
            vaccines,
            specifically those that impact vulnerable affected groups.

            These applications will be evaluated by 14 academic, journalistic and medical judges of the World Health
            Organization.
