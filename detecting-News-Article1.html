        <h3>Detecting Fake-News</h3>

            Detection of fake news online is important in today's society as fresh news content is rapidly being
            produced as a result of the abundance of technology that is present. In the world of false news, there are
            seven main categories and within each category, the piece of fake news content can be visual-and/or
            linguistic-based. In order to detect fake news, both linguistic and non-linguisticcues can be analyzed using
            several methods. While many of these methods of detecting fake news are generally successful, they do have
            some limitations. Varied linguistics cues implies that a new cue set must be designed for a prospective
            situation which makes it difficult to generalize cue and feature engineering methods across different topics
            and domains. Such approaches therefore would require more human involvement in the design process,
            evaluation and utilization of these cues for detection.

            To study how satellite images can be faked, Zhao and his team turned to an AI framework that has been used
            in manipulating other types of digital files. When applied to the field of mapping, the algorithm
            essentially learns the characteristics of satellite images from an urban area, then generates a deepfake
            image by feeding the characteristics of the learned satellite image characteristics onto a different base
            map — similar to how popular image filters can map the features of a human face onto a cat.

            This simplified illustration shows how a simulated satellite image (right) can be generated by putting a
            base map (City A) into a deepfake satellite image model. This model is created by distinguishing a group of
            base map and satellite image pairs from a second city (City B).Zhao et al., 2021, Cartography and Geographic
            Information Science
            <br>
            <br>
            Next, the researchers combined maps and satellite images from three cities — Tacoma, Seattle and Beijing —
            to compare features and create new images of one city, drawn from the characteristics of the other two. They
            designated Tacoma their “base map” city and then explored how geographic features and urban structures of
            Seattle (similar in topography and land use) and Beijing (different in both) could be incorporated to
            produce deepfake images of Tacoma.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the example below, a Tacoma neighborhood is shown in mapping software (top left) and in a satellite image
            (top right). The subsequent deep fake satellite images of the same neighborhood reflect the visual patterns
            of Seattle and Beijing. Low-rise buildings and greenery mark the “Seattle-ized” version of Tacoma on the
            bottom left, while Beijing’s taller buildings, which AI matched to the building structures in the Tacoma
            image, cast shadows — hence the dark appearance of the structures in the image on the bottom right. Yet in
            both, the road networks and building locations are similar.

            from Seattle on the lower left and Beijing on the lower right
            These are maps and satellite images, real and fake, of one Tacoma neighborhood. The top left shows an image
            from mapping software, and the top right is an actual satellite image of the neighborhood. The bottom two
            panels are simulated satellite images of the neighborhood, generated from geospatial data of Seattle (lower
            left) and Beijing (lower right).Zhao et al., 2021, Cartography and Geographic Information Science
            <br>
            <br>
            The untrained eye may have difficulty detecting the differences between real and fake, the researchers point
            out. A casual viewer might attribute the colors and shadows simply to poor image quality. To try to identify
            a “fake,” researchers homed in on more technical aspects of image processing, such as color histograms and
            frequency and spatial domains.

            Some simulated satellite imagery can serve a purpose, Zhao said, especially when representing geographic
            areas over periods of time to, say, understand urban sprawl or climate change. There may be a location for
            which there are no images for a certain period of time in the past, or in forecasting the future, so
            creating new images based on existing ones — and clearly identifying them as simulations — could fill in the
            gaps and help provide perspective.
            <br>
            <br>
            The study’s goal was not to show that geospatial data can be falsified, Zhao said. Rather, the authors hope
            to learn how to detect fake images so that geographers can begin to develop the data literacy tools, similar
            to today’s fact-checking services, for public benefit.

            “As technology continues to evolve, this study aims to encourage more holistic understanding of geographic
            data and information, so that we can demystify the question of absolute reliability of satellite images or
            other geospatial data,” Zhao said. “We also want to develop more future-oriented thinking in order to take
            countermeasures such as fact-checking when necessary,” he said.
